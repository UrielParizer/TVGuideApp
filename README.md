# TVGuideApp
a practice app.

the objective is to create an app that will allow TV addicts like myself to save the location (season, episode) in each show.

C# .NET, Visual Studio 2015, WPF

it can be done in a simple notepad of course, so i will add extra functionality: picture, url to imdb, +1 button to advance the current location by 1 episode.
and more.
